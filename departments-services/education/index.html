<p>Kingsclear First Nation Education Program covers services for children from Kindergarten to Grade 12. We offer services to children at the Band Operated School - Wulastukw Elementary from K-5. Our children then flow into the George Street Middle School and then Fredericton High School for services from grades 6-12.</p>

<p>Post-secondary education services are also provided through Kingsclear First Nation Education where we support students in achieving their post-secondary goals.</p>
