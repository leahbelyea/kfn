<h4>Screening and Information</h4>
<p>This service provides screening and information to individuals and the general public and will help to determine the eligibility of a person to receive agency services.</p>

<h4>Adoption Service</h4>
<p>The adoption service primarily provides for the assessment of individuals or couples who wish to adopt children that are available for adoption and recruitment of families to adopt specific children who require a permanent home. The service prepares children and families for the placement and supports them until the adoption is finalized.</p>

<h4>Post-Adoption Service</h4>
<p>This service provides non-identifying information to specific persons, identifying information under special circumstances, and the preparation of some individuals for reunions between interested parties.</p>

<h4>Child Care/Foster Home Service</h4>
<p>Removal of a child from the family home is only done in cases of extreme abuse or where it is not possible at the time to ensure the safety and security of the child under the present living conditions of that household. Foster homes are a major resource both in and out of the community for the care of children who must be removed temporarily or permanently from their own family home.</p>
