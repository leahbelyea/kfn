<h4>Physicians</h4>
<p>Dr. Saira Athar is a community based family physician and has expressed an interest in the community and is giving one day a week of her time for primary care for all members of the community. She sees patients every Wednesday from 9:00 am – 12noon at the Health Centre and patients at the Wik-Chiplakon, by appointments only. Appointments can be made by calling Amanda at the front desk 363-4001.</p>

<p>Dr. Athar has been with us for almost a year. We are very fortunate to have this opportunity as many of us lack a family physician.</p>
